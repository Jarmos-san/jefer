# How to Use Jefer

As mentioned earlier, Jefer was built with simplicity in mind. In other words,
Jefer compromises on a wide variety of features but takes care of what its
supposed to do **REALLY** well. This intentional withdrawal of certain features
ensures the user knows exactly which command to invoke & when.

That said, this following section will share some more insights on using Jefer
in an CLI environment.

### Initialising a Local Dotfiles Repository

### Removing/Deleting a Local Source File

### Setup a Symlink for a Certain Source File

### List Out All the Source Files & Their Destination
