# Developer Guidelines

Jefer is developed in the open-source community & the source code is free for
all to take a look at, share ideas, feature enhancements & much more! So, if
you are interested in contributing to Jefer's source code as well, this section
of the documentation will guide you through the procedure.

So, if you are still interested in contributing to the project, here's what you
should know/do:

1. Read the contribution guidelines first.

2. Check the open issue/pr threads & see if there's anything you can pick up.
   Also, know that its standard practice to open an issue/discussion thread
   before submitting your pull request.

3. Setup the development environment by following the guidelines discussed in
   the "[_Setting Up the Development Environment_][1]"

4. Learn a bit about using `git` & how to create branches or forks if you are a
   complete beginner. The "[_Git Tutorial by Atlassian BitBucket_][2]" is a good
   to start learning.

And once you're comfortable with everything mentioned above, remember to have
fun contributing to an open-source project. Most of us treat open-source
contribution as a hobby while others treat as a source for learning new stuff
or networking with new people! Whatever your reasons be, don't feel overwhelmed
to contribute to the project!
