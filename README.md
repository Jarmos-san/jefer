# Jefer: A Simple Dotfiles Manager

Jefer is a simple dotfiles management solution written in Asynchronous Python
code.

**How Does Jefer Help?**

If you Google for dotfiles manager, you will stumble upon a countless
alternatives. And each one of those tools are very good due to their
maturity & the community support.

Jefer on the other hand is relatively new (and isn't production-ready yet!).
There's no warranty your dotfiles management which you've been using all this
while workflow will not break. But regardless, if you still want to give Jefer
a try, here's what it has to offer:

1. True cross-platform support thanks to Python (but support for Windows is
   flaky).
2. Jefer stays out of your way when configuring your tools & is responsible
   ONLY for managing your dotfiles, nothing more nothing less.
3. It offers a minimal & intuitive user-experience which means the user no
   longer has to memorise too many command-line options & flags.

That said, those are the core ideas Jefer is being developed upon. But its
implementation details is subject to change until the first MAJOR release.
